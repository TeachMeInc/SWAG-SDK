# TypeScript Support

The SDK provides TypeScript type definitions to enhance the development experience when integrating the SDK into your TypeScript projects. These definitions help with code completion, type checking, and overall code quality.

You can always find the latest version of the type definitions on [GitHub](https://github.com/TeachMeInc/SWAG-SDK/blob/main/platforms/html5/types/swag-api.d.ts).
